### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Spark cluster bottlenecks during peak loads.
---

This incident type refers to a situation where a Spark cluster experiences performance bottlenecks when it is subjected to peak loads. In other words, the Spark cluster struggles to handle the high volume of requests it receives during times of heavy traffic or increased demand. This can lead to slower processing times, delays, or even system crashes. Identifying and resolving the root cause of the bottlenecks is crucial to ensure the smooth functioning of the Spark cluster during peak loads.

### Parameters
```shell
export SPARK_PROCESS_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_CLUSTER_IP="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_PORT_NUMBER="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_LOG_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_CONFIG_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export NUMBER_OF_WORKER_NODES="PLACEHOLDER"

export MEMORY_ALLOCATION_PER_NODE="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Spark cluster's CPU usage during peak loads
```shell
top -bn1 | grep ${SPARK_PROCESS_NAME}
```

### Check Spark cluster's memory usage during peak loads
```shell
free -m
```

### Check Spark cluster's disk usage during peak loads
```shell
df -h
```

### Check if there are any network issues during peak loads
```shell
ping ${SPARK_CLUSTER_IP}
```

### Check if there are any open network connections during peak loads
```shell
netstat -an | grep ${SPARK_PORT_NUMBER}
```

### Check Spark cluster's logs for any errors or warnings during peak loads
```shell
tail -n 500 ${SPARK_LOG_FILE_PATH}
```

### Check Spark cluster's configuration settings during peak loads
```shell
cat ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE_PATH}
```

### Check if there are any other processes or applications competing for resources during peak loads
```shell
top -bn1
```

### Check system load averages during peak loads
```shell
uptime
```

### Insufficient resources allocated to the Spark cluster, leading to bottlenecks during peak loads.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Check available memory

free_mem=$(free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "%.2f%%", $4*100/$2}')

if (( $(echo "$free_mem 80" | bc -l) )); then

   echo "There is insufficient memory available to the Spark cluster"

fi



# Check CPU usage

cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep load | awk '{printf "%.2f%%", $(NF-2)}')

if (( $(echo "$cpu_usage > 80" | bc -l) )); then

   echo "The Spark cluster is using too much CPU power"

fi



# Check disk space

free_disk=$(df -h / | awk '{print $4}' | tail -n 1 | sed 's/G//')

if (( $(echo "$free_disk 80" | bc -l) )); then

   echo "There is insufficient disk space available to the Spark cluster"

fi


```

## Repair

### Optimize the Spark cluster configuration by increasing the number of worker nodes and memory allocation per node to handle peak loads.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set the Spark configuration variables

SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=${NUMBER_OF_WORKER_NODES}

SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=${MEMORY_ALLOCATION_PER_NODE}



# Update the Spark configuration file

sudo sed -i "s/spark.worker.instances.*/spark.worker.instances $SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES/" ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE_PATH}

sudo sed -i "s/spark.worker.memory.*/spark.worker.memory $SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY/" ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE_PATH}



# Restart the Spark cluster

sudo systemctl restart spark


```
