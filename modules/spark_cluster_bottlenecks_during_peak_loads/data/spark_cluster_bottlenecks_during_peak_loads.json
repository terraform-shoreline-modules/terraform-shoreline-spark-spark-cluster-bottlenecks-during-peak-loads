  "description": "This incident type refers to a situation where a Spark cluster experiences performance bottlenecks when it is subjected to peak loads. In other words, the Spark cluster struggles to handle the high volume of requests it receives during times of heavy traffic or increased demand. This can lead to slower processing times, delays, or even system crashes. Identifying and resolving the root cause of the bottlenecks is crucial to ensure the smooth functioning of the Spark cluster during peak loads.",
